# Code The Flag

CTF code examples for future use, as I'm planning on doing a fun CTF next year.

The idea is to cover the basics of exploit development in here, so that more
complicated malware analysis/reverse engineering can be done later.


# Usage

:construction: Work in Progress :construction:


# Requirements

- [ ] `gcc` needs to be installed for the C-based examples
- [ ] `go` needs to be installed for Go-based examples
- [ ] `python3` needs to be installed for Python-based examples
- [ ] Check the project-specific requirement manifests (`go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json` etc)


# Development/Debugging Tools

- [ ] [GDB PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda) (Python Exploit Development Assistance mods for GDB)
- [ ] VIM, of course

Install all requirements via:

```bash
sudo pacman -R emacs; sudo pacman -S vim;
sudo pacman -S binutils coreutils gcc gcc-libs go python3 peda;
```
